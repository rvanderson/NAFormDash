# General
[x] Remove the "Generated by GPT-5" text from the form cards and form pages. Keep that style for future callouts though.
[x] Remove the "AI" tag from the cards

# Forms
[x] The dashboard (admin) user should have the ability to download a CSV of all responses for any form.
[x] The dashboard user should be able to edit the form from the form itself. 

# Edit Form
[ ] Allow the user to change the webhook URL in the edit dialogue
[ ] Allow the user to change the button text in the edit dialogue

# Main Dashboard
[ ] Search: When there is text in the search, there should be an X to clear the search.
[ ] Let's make the cards a little taller to show more of the description.
[ ] The cards should all have the same height.
[ ] The number that is added to the filter when selections are made should have a slightly larger circle.


# Form Generator
[ ] When generating a form using GPT, the description should be generated from the user input, not just copied from the user input.
[ ] When generating a form, the defaults should be  "showProgressBar": "false", if it is only one page
[ ] Automatically refresh the form list after a form is generated.
[ ] Make the success message a toast notification instead of the browser alert.
[ ] Right now the ai can generate basic forms, but it needs more context as to what form fields are available.

# Publishing
[ ] Currently the Draft/Archived/Published status is not real, it's a representation of the form's status in the JSON. The statuses should be Internal/Archived/Public, and they should be an accurate representation of the form's status.
[ ] Cards with the "archived" status should not be displayed in the main dashboard until specifically filtered.

# New Features
[ ] Use the surveyjs form editor to allow native creation and editing of forms. https://github.com/surveyjs/survey-creator
